### What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps.

Helps us understand trends and patterns faster

Example: Coronavirus stats chart

Why we choose Antv?

Rendering of charts

- SVG or Canvas

---

## SVG

- Pros
  - Data visualization will be responsive and scale well with the view size
  - Better accessibility
- Cons
  - This could result in poor performance for a large number of data points

---

## Canvas

- Pros
  - Good performance even with a large number of data points
- Cons
  - Don't scale well with the view size changes, need to re-draw.
  - Less accessible compared to SVG

---

## Best Practices

- Donâ€™t render any data visualizations that are not in the user viewport.
- Use canvas instead of SVG for rendering data visualizations when there are a lot of data points
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
